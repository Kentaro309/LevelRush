# Level Rush – Unreal Engine (Blueprints)

**Level Rush** is a solo-developed third-person action prototype focused on
gameplay systems, Blueprint architecture, modular AI, and level scripting.

This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement a complete
gameplay loop using Unreal Engine Blueprints.
